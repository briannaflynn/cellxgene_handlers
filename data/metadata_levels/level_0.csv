17,"A mammalian brain is comprised of numerous cell types organized in an intricate manner to form functional neural circuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a powerful approach to identify cell types based on their gene expression profiles and has revealed many distinct cell populations in the brain. Single-cell epigenomic profiling further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of different cell types. Understanding how different cell types contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell dissociation. Here, we used an in situ single-cell transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), to generate a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex (MOp). We profiled ∼300,000 cells in the MOp, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters, and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory neuronal clusters but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters adopted layered organizations. Notably, intratelencephalic (IT) cells, the largest branch of neurons in the MOp, formed a continuous spectrum of cells with gradual changes in both gene expression profiles and cortical depth positions in a highly correlated manner. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with retrograde tracing to probe the projection targets for different MOp neuronal cell types and found that projections of MOp neurons to other cortical regions formed a many-to-many network with each target region receiving input preferentially from a different composition of IT clusters. Overall, our results provide a high-resolution spatial and projection map of molecularly defined cell types in the MOp. We anticipate that the imaging platform described here can be broadly applied to create high-resolution cell atlases of a wide range of systems.",1

42,"First draft atlas of human brain transcriptomic cell types: The human brain directs a wide range of complex behaviors ranging from fine motor skills to abstract intelligence and emotion.  This broad range of functions is supported by an exceptionally complex cellular and circuit architecture.  To create a first draft human brain cell atlas, high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing was used to systematically survey cells across the entire adult human brain in three postmortem donors. Over three million nuclei were sampled from approximately 100 dissections across the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Analysis of these data showed regional diversity in that cellular organization exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales, identifying 30 superclusters, 461 clusters and 3313 subclusters.  As the first single-cell transcriptomic census of the entire human brain, this atlas provides a resource for understanding the molecular diversity of the human brain in health and disease. The Human Brain Cell Atlas v1.0 is presented for visualization and data mining through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s CellxGene application, with the following biologically meaningful partitions: 1. Neuronal and non-neuronal cell types 2. Supercluster-specific groupings (”Supercluster: ”) 3.Brain region-specific groupings (”Dissection: “), ordered by the adult human brain anatomical reference atlas ontology in Ding et al. (2016)",1

53,"Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience mild coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), some patients suffer from severe COVID-19, which is
accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation.
To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed
single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained
from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with
severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory
signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of
the TNF/IL-1β-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In
classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response
co-existed with the TNF/IL-1β-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in
patients with milder COVID-19. Interestingly, we documented type I IFN-driven
inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well. Based on this,
we propose that the type I IFN response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating
inflammation in severe COVID-19.",1

Coupling single-cell methods with spatial analysis has allowed a comprehensive cellular survey of the epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial, and erythrocyte/leukocyte compartments from 5–22 post-conception weeks. We identify previously uncharacterized cell states in all compartments. These include developmental-specific secretory progenitors and a subtype of neuroendocrine cell related to human small cell lung cancer. Our datasets are available through our web interface (https://lungcellatlas.org). To illustrate its general utility, we use our cell atlas to generate predictions about cell-cell signaling and transcription factor hierarchies which we rigorously test using organoid models.",1

90,"White adipose tissue (WAT), once regarded as morphologically and functionally bland, is now recognized to be dynamic, plastic, heterogenous, and involved in a wide array of biological processes including energy homeostasis, glucose and lipid handling, blood pressure control, and host defense.  High fat feeding and other metabolic stressors cause dramatic changes in adipose morphology, physiology, and cellular composition, and alterations in adiposity are associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we provide detailed cellular atlases of human and murine subcutaneous and visceral white fat at single cell resolution across a range of body weight.  We identify subpopulations of adipocytes, adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs), vascular, and immune cells and demonstrate commonalities and differences across species and dietary conditions.  We link specific cell types to increased risk of metabolic disease, and we provide an initial blueprint for a comprehensive set of interactions between individual cell types in the adipose niche in leanness and obesity.  These data comprise a extensive resource for the exploration of genes, traits, and cell types in the function of WAT across species, depots, and nutritional conditions.",1

111,"Human blood samples were obtained from a cohort of patients under SARS-CoV-2 infection with pre-existing immunological condition, including patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (Ps), Sjogren syndrome (Sj), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Immunodeficient patients consisted in individuals diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), missing IgA and IgM isotypes and displaying missing or reduced IgG, as well as one individual with lymphopenia and another with bone marrow failure of unknown origin. In some cases, PBMCs samples before, during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from the same individual (CVID patient 1 and CVID patient 2). For some individuals, nasal swab samples were also collected in parallel with the PBMC sample. For nasal sample collection, the swab was gently inserted along the nasal septum, just above the floor of the nasal passage, to the nasopharynx, until resistance was felt and then the swab was rotated 5 times. The patients were previously diagnosed according to European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) criteria and established criteria for autoimmune diseases (Perricone and Valesini, 2014). They were collected at Hospital La Paz, Hospital La Princesa, Hospital Vall d’Hebron, Hospital Can Ruti and Hospital Bellvitge (Spain), and Medical Center-University of Freiburg (Germany). All donors received oral and written information about the possibility that their blood and nasal biopsies would be used for research purposes, and any questions that arose were then answered. Before giving their first sample the donors signed a consent form approved by the Ethics Committee at their corresponding hospitals, which adhered to the principles set out in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki.",1

We developed light-sensitive human retinal organoids with multiple nuclear and synaptic layers and functional synapses. We sequenced the RNA of 285,441 single cells from these organoids at seven developmental time points and from the periphery, fovea, pigment epithelium and choroid of light-responsive adult human retinas, and performed histochemistry. Cell types in organoids matured in vitro to a stable “developed” state at a rate similar to human retina development in vivo. Transcriptomes of organoid cell types converged toward the transcriptomes of adult peripheral retinal cell types. Expression of disease-associated genes was cell-type-specific in adult retina, and cell-type specificity was retained in organoids. We implicate unexpected cell types in diseases such as macular degeneration.

Here, we generated a high-resolution cell atlas of brain aging within the frontal cortex and striatum using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics and quantified changes in gene expression and spatial organization of major cell types in these regions over the mouse lifespan. We observed substantially more pronounced changes in cell state, gene expression, and spatial organization of non-neuronal cells over neurons. Our data revealed molecular and spatial signatures of glial and immune cell activation during aging, particularly enriched in the subcortical white matter, and identified both similarities and notable differences in cell-activation patterns induced by aging and systemic inflammatory challenge.

177,"The thalamus is the principal information hub of the vertebrate brain, with essential roles in sensory and motor information processing, attention, and memory. The complex array of thalamic nuclei develops from a restricted pool of neural progenitors. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing and regional abrogation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these thalamic lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson’s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.",1

188,"The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates computational methods that can define cellular states based on multimodal data. Here, we introduce “weighted-nearest neighbor” analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.",1

We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell type–specific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular properties.",1

Here we applied single-cell RNA-seq to profile 59,738 FT cells from 4 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed 17,798 cells from two hydrosalpinx samples and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease.",1

Using single-cell transcriptomics and an advanced analytical strategy to assess pancreatic islets of T1D, autoantibody-positive, and non-diabetic organ donors, we identified both canonical cell types and rare insulin-expressing cells with a hybrid mixture of endocrine and exocrine gene signatures within all donors. We further found elevated expression of MHC Class II pathway genes in exocrine ductal cells of T1D donors, which we confirmed through CyTOF, in situ imaging mass cytometry, and immunofluorescence analysis.

256,"Malformations of or injuries to the developing lung are associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality with lifelong consequences for subsequent pulmonary health. One fetal exposure linked with poor health outcomes is chorioamnionitis, which impacts up to 25-40% of preterm births. Severe chorioamnionitis with prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of pulmonary disease and secondary infections in childhood, suggesting that fetal inflammation may significantly alter developmental ontogeny of the lung. To test this hypothesis, we used intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) to generate experimental chorioamnionitis in prenatal Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), a model which shares critical structural and temporal aspects of human lung development. Inflammatory injury directly disrupts the developing gas exchange surface of the primate lung, with extensive damage to alveolar structure, particularly the close association and coordinated differentiation of alveolar type 1 pneumocytes and specialized alveolar capillary endothelium. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis defined a multicellular alveolar signaling niche driving alveologenesis which was extensively disrupted by perinatal inflammation, leading to loss of gas exchange surface and alveolar simplification similar to that found in chronic lung disease of newborns. Blockade of IL1b and TNFa ameliorated endotoxin-induced inflammatory lung injury by blunting stromal response to inflammation and modulating innate immune activation in myeloid cells, restoring structural integrity and key signaling networks in the developing alveolus. These data provide new insight into the pathophysiology of developmental lung injury and suggest that modulating inflammation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent fetal consequences of chorioamnionitis.",1

278,"Tau aggregation in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is closely associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the molecular signatures that distinguish between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant cell states are unknown. We developed a FACS-based method for the high-throughput isolation of individual somas with NFTs from frozen human brain and profiled the transcriptomes of 63,110 somas with or without NFTs from the prefrontal cortex of eight Braak VI AD donors, and 57,534 somas from eight age-matched healthy donors. We quantified the susceptibility of 20 neocortical subtypes for NFT formation and cell death, and identified the shared and cell-type-specific signatures associated with NFTs. NFT-bearing neurons shared a marked upregulation of synaptic transmission-related genes, including a core set of 63 genes enriched for synaptic vesicle cycling. Oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction were highly cell-type dependent. Apoptosis was only modestly enriched, and the susceptibilities of NFT-bearing and NFT-free neurons for death were highly similar. Our analysis suggests that NFTs represent cell-type-specific compensatory responses to stress and synaptic dysfunction. We provide a resource for biomarker discovery and investigation of tau-dependent and tau-independent mechanisms of neurodegeneration.  

Note: FACS sorted populations: MAP2+/AT8- somas from AD donors (aka MAP2 or NFT-free);  MAP2+/AT8+ somas from AD donors (aka AT8 or NFT-bearing); MAP2+ somas from healthy controls (aka MAP2control)",1

289,"Within the vertebrate neocortex and other telencephalic structures, molecularly-defined neurons tend to segregate at first order into inhibitory (GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) types. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing, analyzing over 2.4 million brain cells sampled from 16 locations in a primate (the common marmoset) to ask whether (1) neurons generally segregate by neurotransmitter status, and (2) neurons expressing the same neurotransmitters share additional molecular features in common, beyond the few genes directly responsible for neurotransmitter synthesis and release. We find the answer to both is “no”: there is a remarkable degree of transcriptional similarity between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons found in the same brain structure, and there is generally little in common between glutamatergic neurons residing in phylogenetically divergent brain structures. The origin effect is permanent: we find that cell types that cross cephalic boundaries in development retain the transcriptional identities of their birthplaces. GABAergic interneurons, which migrate widely, follow highly specialized and distinct distributions in striatum and neocortex. We use interneuron-restricted AAVs to reveal the morphological diversity of molecularly defined types. Our analyses expose how lineage and functional class sculpt the transcriptional identity and biodistribution of primate neurons.",1

Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% of patients require intensive care. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes, lymphopenia, and T cell exhaustion. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, we provide a cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19.",1

Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand–receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell–cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the maternal–fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and reproductive success.",1

358,"The human immune system displays remarkable variation between individuals, leading to differences in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We present single cell RNA sequence data from 1,267,768 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTL, with the majority showing cell type specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells transitioning from naïve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to inter-individual variation in immune function. Finally, utilizing a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level. This work brings together genetic epidemiology with scRNA-seq to uncover drivers of inter-individual variation in the immune system.",1

369,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly. However, it has been challenging to identify the cell types associated with AMD given the genetic complexity of the disease. Here we perform massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human retinas using two independent platforms, and report the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina. Using a multi-resolution network-based analysis, we identify all major retinal cell types, and their corresponding gene expression signatures. Heterogeneity is observed within macroglia, suggesting that human retinal glia are more diverse than previously thought. Finally, GWAS-based enrichment analysis identifies glia, vascular cells, and cone photoreceptors to be associated with the risk of AMD. These data provide a detailed analysis of the human retina, and show how scRNA-seq can provide insight into cell types involved in complex, inflammatory genetic diseases.",1

First, we established the feasibility of Slide-seqV2 in human kidney by analyzing tissue from 9 distinct donors, which revealed a cell neighborhood centered around a population of LYVE1+ macrophages. Second, in a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease, we detected changes in the cellular organization of the spatially-restricted kidney filter and blood flow regulating apparatus. Third, in a mouse model of a toxic proteinopathy, we identified previously unknown, disease-specific cell neighborhoods centered around macrophages. In a spatially-restricted subpopulation of epithelial cells, we also found perturbations in 77 genes associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), including Tmed9. Treatment with a TMED9-targeting compound showed efficient removal of toxic mutant proteins and reversal of the UPR.

We assessed more than 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. Although most cell subtypes defined transcriptomically are conserved, we detected several that exist only in a subset of species as well as substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial, and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin and tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production in certain interneurons. The above molecular differences are also illustrated by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2, which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer 4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of the dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates",1

493,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing global health threat with more than two million infected people since its emergence in late 2019. Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host responses, and disease progression. We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Lastly, we identified heat shock proin 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels. In summary, our study established in vitro cell culture models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified HSP90 protein as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",1

Here, we comprehensively examine human brain cell epigenomes by probing DNA methylation and chromatin conformation at single-cell resolution in over 500,000 cells from 46 brain regions. We identified 188 cell types and characterized their molecular signatures. Integrative analyses revealed concordant changes in DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, chromatin organization, and gene expression across cell types, cortical areas, and basal ganglia structures. With these resources, we developed scMCodes that reliably predict brain cell types using their methylation status at select genomic sites. This multimodal epigenomic brain cell atlas provides new insights into the complexity of cell type-specific gene regulation in the adult human brain",1

526,"The human thymus is the organ responsible for the maturation of many types of T cells, which are immune cells that protect us from infection. However, it is not well known how these cells develop with a full immune complement that contains the necessary variation to protect us from a variety of pathogens. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing on more than 250,000 cells, Park et al. examined the changes that occur in the thymus over the course of a human life. They found that development occurs in a coordinated manner among immune cells and with their developmental microenvironment. These data allowed for the creation of models of how T cells with different specific immune functions develop in humans.",1

537,"Current smoking is associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19, but it is not clear how cigarette smoke (CS) exposure affects SARS-CoV-2 airway cell infection. We directly exposed air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term CS and then infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after CS exposure with a lack of ABSC proliferation. Single-cell profiling of the cultures showed that the normal interferon response was reduced after CS exposure with infection. Treatment of CS-exposed ALI cultures with interferon β-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting one potential mechanism for more severe viral infection. Our data show that acute CS exposure allows for more severe airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the innate immune response and ABSC proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to CS.",1

We describe distinct helper T cell activation and migration profiles along the colon and characterize the transcriptional adaptation trajectory of regulatory T cells between lymphoid tissue and colon.

569,"Cortical neurons exhibit extreme diversity in gene expression as well as in morphological and electrophysiological properties. Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic or morpho-electric criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells. Here we used Patch-seq to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.",1

580,"Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination elicit potent immune responses, but the durability and scope of immune responses remain to be elucidated. Here, we performed multimodal single- cell profiling of peripheral blood of patients with acute COVID-19 and healthy volunteers before and after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and booster, and compared the immune responses elicited by the virus and by the vaccine. Phenotypic and transcriptional profiling of immune cells, coupled with reconstruction of B cell and T cell receptor repertoires, enabled us to compare the host responses to the virus and to defined viral antigens. In COVID-19 patients, immune responses were characterized by a highly augmented interferon signature which was largely absent in vaccine recipients. We also observed a striking upregulation of cytotoxic genes in the peripheral T cells and innate-like lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients that was absent among healthy vaccinated individuals. These observations, were readily validated in an independent single-cell sequencing dataset. Analysis of B and T cell repertoires revealed that while the majority of clonal lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients were effector cells, in vaccine recipients clonal expansion was more evident among circulating memory cells. Furthermore, while clonal αβ T cell responses were observed in both COVID-19 patients and vaccine recipients, dramatic expansion of circulating clonal gdT cells was found only infected individuals. Overall, our analysis of immune responses to infection and to the mRNA vaccine revealed that while differences exist in response to infection compared to response to defined antigen, the vaccine elicits a robust adaptive immune response in the absence of severe inflammation associated with infection with notable increase in clonal B and T cell memory responses.",1

591,"Single cell transcriptomics has transformed the characterization of brain cell identity by providing quantitative molecular signatures for large, unbiased samples of brain cell populations. With the proliferation of taxonomies based on individual datasets, a major challenge is to integrate and validate results toward defining biologically meaningful cell types. We used a battery of single-cell transcriptome and epigenome measurements generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) to comprehensively assess the molecular signatures of cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex (MOp). We further developed computational and statistical methods to integrate these multimodal data and quantitatively validate the reproducibility of the cell types. The reference atlas, based on more than 600,000 high quality single-cell or -nucleus samples assayed by six molecular modalities, is a comprehensive molecular account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in MOp. Collectively, our study indicates that the mouse primary motor cortex contains over 55 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies, and modalities. We find many concordant multimodal markers for each cell type, as well as thousands of genes and gene regulatory elements with discrepant transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures. These data highlight the complex molecular regulation of brain cell types and will directly enable design of reagents to target specific MOp cell types for functional analysis.",1

Yet, the molecular features associated with DA neuron vulnerability have not yet been fully identified. To comprehensively characterize nigral DA neuron types and their relative vulnerabilities to PD, we developed a protocol to enrich and transcriptionally profile thousands of DA neurons from PD patients and matched controls, sampling a total of 387,483 nuclei, including 22,048 DA neuron profiles. We identified 10 populations and spatially localized each within the SNpc using Slide-seq. A single subtype, marked by the expression of the gene AGTR1 and spatially confined to the ventral tier of SNpc, was highly susceptible to loss and showed the strongest upregulation of targets of TP53 and NR2F2, nominating molecular processes associated with degeneration in vivo. This same vulnerable population was specifically enriched for the heritable risk associated with PD, highlighting the importance of cell-intrinsic pathways in determining the differential vulnerability of DA neurons to PD-associated degeneration.

687,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affecting the human respiratory system severely challenges public health and urgently demands for increasing our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, especially host factors facilitating virus infection and replication. SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is strongly expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a rich resource for future investigations of COVID-19 infection and pathogenesis.",1

698,"Single-cell transcriptomics promises to revolutionize our understanding of the vasculature. Emerging computational methods applied to high dimensional single cell data allow integration of results between samples and species, and illuminate the diversity and underlying developmental and architectural organization of cell populations. Here, we illustrate these methods in analysis of mouse lymph node (LN) lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) at single cell resolution. Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not recognized previously as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates known and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for (1) subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells, (2) subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation, and (3) medullary subset specialization for pathogen interactions and LN remodeling. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN.",1

Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of >50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8+ T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4+ T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease.",1

719,"Multimodal single cell sequencing is a powerful tool for interrogating cell-specific changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility. We performed single nucleus RNA (snRNA-seq) and assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq) on human kidney cortex from donors with and without diabetic kidney disease (DKD) to identify altered signaling pathways and transcription factors associated with DKD. Both snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq had an increased proportion of VCAM1+ injured proximal tubule cells (PT_VCAM1) in DKD samples. PT_VCAM1 has a pro-inflammatory expression signature and transcription factor motif enrichment implicated NFkB signaling. We used stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression to partition heritability of kidney-function-related traits using publicly-available GWAS summary statistics. Cell-specific PT_VCAM1 peaks were enriched for heritability of chronic kidney disease (CKD), suggesting that genetic background may regulate chromatin accessibility and DKD progression. snATAC-seq found cell-specific differentially accessible regions (DAR) throughout the nephron that change accessibility in DKD and these regions were enriched for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) motifs. Changes in chromatin accessibility were associated with decreased expression of insulin receptor, increased gluconeogenesis, and decreased expression of the GR cytosolic chaperone, FKBP5, in the diabetic proximal tubule. Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) profiling of GR binding in bulk kidney cortex and an in vitro model of the proximal tubule (RPTEC) showed that DAR co-localize with GR binding sites. CRISPRi silencing of GR response elements (GRE) in the FKBP5 gene body reduced FKBP5 expression in RPTEC, suggesting that reduced FKBP5 chromatin accessibility in DKD may alter cellular response to GR. We developed an open-source tool for single cell allele specific analysis (SALSA) to model the effect of genetic background on gene expression. Heterozygous germline single nucleotide variants (SNV) in proximal tubule ATAC peaks were associated with allele-specific chromatin accessibility and differential expression of target genes within cis-coaccessibility networks. Partitioned heritability of proximal tubule ATAC peaks with a predicted allele-specific effect was enriched for eGFR, suggesting that genetic background may modify DKD progression in a cell-specific manner.",1

Anatomically, the hippocampus runs along a longitudinal axis, posterior to anterior in primates. The structure, function, and connectivity of the hippocampus vary along this axis. In human hippocampus, longitudinal functional heterogeneity remains an active area of investigation, and structural heterogeneity has not been described. To understand the cellular and molecular diversity along the hippocampal long axis in human brain and define molecular signatures corresponding to functional domains, we performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing on surgically resected human anterior and posterior hippocampus from epilepsy patients, identifying differentially expressed genes at cellular resolution. We further identify axis- and cell-type-specific gene expression signatures that differentially intersect with human genetic signals, identifying cell-type-specific genes in the posterior hippocampus for cognitive function and the anterior hippocampus for mood and affect. These data are accessible as a public resource through an interactive website.",1

Here we present a spatial proteogenomic atlas of the healthy and obese human and murine liver combining single-cell CITE-seq, single-nuclei sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics. By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis.",1

763,"Pancreatic islets of Langerhans secrete hormones to regulate systemic glucose levels. Emerging evidence suggests that islet cells are functionally heterogeneous to allow a fine-tuned and efficient endocrine response to physiological changes. A precise description of the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, in particular linking animal models to human islets, is an important step towards identifying the factors critical for endocrine cell function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile more than 50’000 endocrine cells isolated from healthy human, pig and mouse pancreatic islets and characterize transcriptional heterogeneity and evolutionary conservation of those cells across the three species. We systematically delineated endocrine cell types and α- and β-cell heterogeneity through prior knowledge- and data-driven gene sets shared across species, which altogether capture common and differential cellular properties, transcriptional dynamics and putative driving factors of state transitions. We showed that global endocrine expression profiles correlate, and that critical identity and functional markers are shared between species, while only approximately 20% of cell type enriched expression is conserved. We resolved distinct human α- and β-cell states that form continuous transcriptional landscapes. These states differentially activate maturation and hormone secretion programs, which are related to regulatory hormone receptor expression, signaling pathways and different types of cellular stress responses. Finally, we mapped mouse and pig cells to the human reference and observed that the spectrum of human α- and β-cell heterogeneity and aspects of such functional gene expression are better recapitulated in the pig than mouse data. Here, we provide a high-resolution transcriptional map of healthy human islet cells and their murine and porcine counterparts, which is easily queryable via an online interface. This comprehensive resource informs future efforts that focus on pancreatic endocrine function, failure and regeneration, and enables to assess molecular conservation in islet biology across species for translational purposes.",1

774,"Most irreversible blindness results from retinal disease. To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of ~85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90% of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing.",1

787,"As the light sensing part of the visual system, the human retina is composed of five classes of neuron, including photoreceptors, horizontal cells, amacrine, bipolar, and retinal ganglion cells. Each class of neuron can be further classified into subgroups with the abundance varying three orders of magnitude. Therefore, to capture all cell types in the retina and generate a complete single cell reference atlas, it is essential to scale up from currently published single cell profiling studies to improve the sensitivity. In addition, to gain a better understanding of gene regulation at single cell level, it is important to include sufficient scATAC-seq data in the reference. To fill the gap, we performed snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq for the retina from healthy donors. To further increase the size of the dataset, we then collected and incorporated publicly available datasets. All data underwent a unified preprocessing pipeline and data integration. Multiple integration methods were benchmarked by scIB, and scVI was chosen. To harness the power of multiomics, snATAC-seq datasets were also preprocessed, and scGlue was used to generate co-embeddings between snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq cells. To facilitate the public use of references, we employ CELLxGENE and UCSC Cell Browser for visualization. By combining previously published and newly generated datasets, a single cell atlas of the human retina that is composed of 2.5 million single cells from 48 donors has been generated. As a result, over 90 distinct cell types are identified based on the transcriptomics profile with the rarest cell type accounting for about 0.01% of the cell population. In addition, open chromatin profiling has been generated for over 400K nuclei via single nuclei ATAC-seq, allowing systematic characterization of cis-regulatory elements for individual cell type. Integrative analysis reveals intriguing differences in the transcriptome, chromatin landscape, and gene regulatory network among cell class, subgroup, and type. In addition, changes in cell proportion, gene expression and chromatin openness have been observed between different gender and over age. Accessible through interactive browsers, this study represents the most comprehensive reference cell atlas of the human retina to date. As part of the human cell atlas project, this resource lays the foundation for further research in understanding retina biology and diseases.",1

807,"The cellular landscape of the human intestinal tract is dynamic throughout life, developing in utero and changing in response to functional requirements and environmental exposures. To comprehensively map cell lineages in the healthy developing, pediatric and adult human gut from ten distinct anatomical regions, as well as draining lymph nodes, we used single cell RNA-seq and VDJ analysis of roughly one third of a million cells. This reveals the presence of BEST4+ absorptive cells throughout the human intestinal tract, demonstrating the existence of this cell type beyond the colon for the first time. Furthermore, we implicate IgG sensing as a novel function of intestinal tuft cells, and link these cells to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. We define novel glial and neuronal cell populations in the developing enteric nervous system, and predict cell-type specific expression of Hirschsprung’s disease-associated genes. Finally, using a systems approach, we identify key cell players across multiple cell lineages driving secondary lymphoid tissue formation in early human development. We show that these programs are adopted in inflammatory bowel disease to recruit and retain immune cells at the site of inflammation. These data provide an unprecedented catalogue of intestinal cells, and new insights into cellular programs in development, homeostasis and disease.",1

819,"Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood. To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of Mus musculus that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing—such as senescence, genomic instability and changes in the immune system. This transcriptomic atlas—which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.",1

830,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss. To better understand disease pathogenesis and identify causal genes in GWAS loci for AMD risk, we present a comprehensive database of human retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Our database comprises macular and non-macular RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from 129 donors, a genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset that includes macula-specific retina and RPE/choroid, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (NucSeq) from human retina and RPE with subtype resolution from more than 100,000 cells. Using NucSeq, we find enriched expression of AMD candidate genes in RPE cells. We identify 15 putative causal genes for AMD on the basis of co-localization of genetic association signals for AMD risk and eye eQTL, including the genes TSPAN10 and TRPM1. These results demonstrate the value of our human eye database for elucidating genetic pathways and potential therapeutic targets for ocular diseases.",1

840,"The relationship between the human placenta—the extraembryonic organ made by the fetus, and the decidua—the mucosal layer of the uterus, is essential to nurture and protect the fetus during pregnancy. Extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs) derived from placental villi infiltrate the decidua, transforming the maternal arteries into high-conductance vessels. Defects in trophoblast invasion and arterial transformation established during early pregnancy underlie common pregnancy disorders such as pre-eclampsia. Here we have generated a spatially resolved multiomics single-cell atlas of the entire human maternal–fetal interface including the myometrium, which enables us to resolve the full trajectory of trophoblast differentiation. We have used this cellular map to infer the possible transcription factors mediating EVT invasion and show that they are preserved in in vitro models of EVT differentiation from primary trophoblast organoids and trophoblast stem cells. We define the transcriptomes of the final cell states of trophoblast invasion: placental bed giant cells (fused multinucleated EVTs) and endovascular EVTs (which form plugs inside the maternal arteries). We predict the cell–cell communication events contributing to trophoblast invasion and placental bed giant cell formation, and model the dual role of interstitial EVTs and endovascular EVTs in mediating arterial transformation during early pregnancy. Together, our data provide a comprehensive analysis of postimplantation trophoblast differentiation that can be used to inform the design of experimental models of the human placenta in early pregnancy.",1

851,"Neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons (IFNs) have been found in some patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the prevalence of these antibodies, their longitudinal dynamics across the disease severity scale, and their functional effects on circulating leukocytes remain unknown. Here, in 284 patients with COVID-19, we found type I IFN-specific autoantibodies in peripheral blood samples from 19% of patients with critical disease and 6% of patients with severe disease. We found no type I IFN autoantibodies in individuals with moderate disease. Longitudinal profiling of over 600,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiplexed single-cell epitope and transcriptome sequencing from 54 patients with COVID-19 and 26 non-COVID-19 controls revealed a lack of type I IFN-stimulated gene (ISG-I) responses in myeloid cells from patients with critical disease. This was especially evident in dendritic cell populations isolated from patients with critical disease producing type I IFN-specific autoantibodies. Moreover, we found elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1) on the surface of monocytes isolated from patients with critical disease early in the disease course. LAIR1 expression is inversely correlated with ISG-I expression response in patients with COVID-19 but is not expressed in healthy controls. The deficient ISG-I response observed in patients with critical COVID-19 with and without type I IFN-specific autoantibodies supports a unifying model for disease pathogenesis involving ISG-I suppression through convergent mechanisms.",1

Our benchmark of the endometrial organoids reveals the pathways and cell states regulating differentiation of the secretory and ciliated lineages both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro downregulation of WNT or NOTCH pathways increases the differentiation efficiency along the secretory and ciliated lineages, respectively. We utilize our cellular maps to deconvolute bulk data from endometrial cancers and endometriotic lesions, illuminating the cell types dominating in each of these disorders.

871,"Clinical benefits of cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn’s disease (iCD) are limited to a subset of patients. Here, we applied single-cell technologies to iCD lesions to address whether cellular heterogeneity contributes to treatment resistance. We found that a subset of patients expressed a unique cellular module in inflamed tissues that consisted of IgG plasma cells, inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes, activated T cells, and stromal cells, which we named the GIMATS module. Analysis of ligand-receptor interaction pairs identified a distinct network connectivity that likely drives the GIMATS module. Strikingly, the GIMATS module was also present in a subset of patients in four independent iCD cohorts (n = 441), and its presence at diagnosis correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission upon anti-TNF therapy. These results emphasize the limitations of current diagnostic assays and the potential for single-cell mapping tools to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities.",1

880,"A collection of in situ, spatially resolved transcriptomic profiles of individual cells across the whole mouse brain by multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) imaged using an 1122 gene panel, consisting of ~10 million cells. We performed MERFISH imaging on 245 coronal and sagittal sections from four animals, and obtained ~10 million segmented cells, of which ~9.3 million cells passed the cell volume and doublets quality controls. We integrated the 9.3-million-cell MERFISH data with the scRNA-seq data from the Allen Institute to classify cells. We then removed fractured tissue slices and registered the spatial coordinates of the cells to the Allen mouse brain common coordinate framework (CCF) version 3. Then, we filtered cells that substantially passed the midline in coronal slices and those that passed the CCF posterior edge in sagittal slices. 8.4 million cells passed the filters. The files in this data collection contain the 8.4 million filtered cells. The rostral-caudal positions of coronal slices and medial-lateral positions of sagittal slices can be defined by their CCF coordinates. For coronal slices that cannot be registered to CCF, the rostral-caudal positions can be estimated by the intervals between slices (100µm for animal 1 and 200µm for animal 2).

898,"The human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are complex tissues that provide crucial support to the retina. Disease affecting either of these supportive tissues can lead to irreversible blindness in the setting of age-related macular degeneration. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on macular and peripheral regions of RPE-choroid from 7 human donor eyes in 2 independent experiments. In the first experiment, total RPE/choroid preparations were evaluated and expression profiles specific to RPE and major choroidal cell populations were identified. As choroidal endothelial cells represent a minority of the total RPE/choroidal cell population but are strongly implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, a second single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment was performed using endothelial cells enriched by magnetic separation. In this second study, we identified gene expression signatures along the choroidal vascular tree, classifying the transcriptome of human choriocapillaris, arterial, and venous endothelial cells. We found that the choriocapillaris highly and specifically expresses the regulator of cell cycle gene (RGCC), a gene that responds to complement activation and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. In addition, RGCC was the most up-regulated choriocapillaris gene in a donor diagnosed with AMD. These results provide a characterization of the human RPE and choriocapillaris transcriptome, offering potential insight into the mechanisms of choriocapillaris response to complement injury and choroidal vascular disease in age-related macular degeneration.",1

909,"The critical functions of the human liver are coordinated through the interactions of hepatic parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Recent advances in single cell transcriptional approaches have enabled an examination of the human liver with unprecedented resolution. However, dissociation related cell perturbation can limit the ability to fully capture the human liver’s parenchymal cell fraction, which limits the ability to comprehensively profile this organ. Here, we report the transcriptional landscape of 73,295 cells from the human liver using matched single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). The addition of snRNA-seq enabled the characterization of interzonal hepatocytes at single-cell resolution, revealed the presence of rare subtypes of hepatic stellate cells previously only seen in disease, and detection of cholangiocyte progenitors that had only been observed during in vitro differentiation experiments. However, T and B lymphocytes and NK cells were only distinguishable using scRNA-seq, highlighting the importance of applying both technologies to obtain a complete map of tissue-resident cell-types. We validated the distinct spatial distribution of the hepatocyte, cholangiocyte and stellate cell populations by an independent spatial transcriptomics dataset and immunohistochemistry. Our study provides a systematic comparison of the transcriptomes captured by scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq and delivers a high-resolution map of the parenchymal cell populations in the healthy human liver.",1

920,"Osmotic equilibrium and membrane potential in animal cells depend on concentration gradients of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the plasma membrane, a function catalyzed by the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. Here, we describe ATP1A3 variants encoding dysfunctional α3-subunits in children affected by polymicrogyria, a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by abnormal folding and laminar organization. To gain cell-biological insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of prenatal ATP1A3 expression, we built an ATP1A3 transcriptional atlas of fetal cortical development using mRNA in situ hybridization and transcriptomic profiling of ∼125,000 individual cells with single-cell RNA sequencing (Drop-seq) from 11 areas of the midgestational human neocortex. We found that fetal expression of ATP1A3 is most abundant to a subset of excitatory neurons carrying transcriptional signatures of the developing subplate, yet also maintains expression in nonneuronal cell populations. Moving forward a year in human development, we profiled ∼52,000 nuclei from four areas of an infant neocortex and show that ATP1A3 expression persists throughout early postnatal development, most predominantly in inhibitory neurons, including parvalbumin interneurons in the frontal cortex. Finally, we discovered the heteromeric Na+,K+-ATPase pump complex may form nonredundant cell-type–specific α-β isoform combinations, including α3-β1 in excitatory neurons and α3-β2 in inhibitory neurons. Together, the developmental malformation phenotype of affected individuals and single-cell ATP1A3 expression patterns point to a key role for α3 in human cortex development, as well as a cell-type basis for pre- and postnatal ATP1A3-associated diseases.",1

964,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and is notoriously difficult to treat because of its diffuse nature. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3,589 cells in a cohort of four patients. We obtained cells from the tumor core as well as surrounding peripheral tissue. Our analysis revealed cellular variation in the tumor's genome and transcriptome. We were also able to identify infiltrating neoplastic cells in regions peripheral to the core lesions. Despite the existence of significant heterogeneity among neoplastic cells, we found that infiltrating GBM cells share a consistent gene signature between patients, suggesting a common mechanism of infiltration. Additionally, in investigating the immunological response to the tumors, we found transcriptionally distinct myeloid cell populations residing in the tumor core and the surrounding peritumoral space. Our data provide a detailed dissection of GBM cell types, revealing an abundance of information about tumor formation and migration.",1

986,"The vast majority of deaths are due to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS), or direct complications thereof. The progression to ARDS is thought to reflect a combination of increasing viral load, cytopathic effects, translocation of virus into pulmonary tissue, including infection of pulmonary endothelial cells, and inappropriate or insufficient immune responses. Since ARDS is an acute inflammatory injury to the lung, we hypothesize that COVID-19 associated ARDS develops, at least in part, as a direct result of a dysfunctional host immune response that contributes to clinical deterioration in the acute phase of systemic illness, leading to ineffective viral clearance and collateral pulmonary or other tissue damage. Understanding immune signaling that is enhanced or suppressed in patients with worse outcomes has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets for COVID-19 associated ARDS, and knowing the kinetics of potentially pathogenic immune responses will inform the optimal timing of interventions. To address this, the immune and cellular response of infected patients needs to be analyzed comprehensively. Single-cell multi-omics strategies are uniquely poised to do this, given the substantial cellular complexity and the minute clinical samples. Our goals are to rapidly define immune cell states and signaling pathways in COVID-19 that are associated with ARDS severity and to investigate the role of these pathways in ARDS. To achieve this, we enrolled patients in the Emergency Department (ED) in a large, urban, academic hospital from 3/24/2020 to 4/30/2020 in Boston during the peak of the COVID-19 surge, with an institutional IRB-approved waiver of informed consent.",1

1007,"Multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy, is the second most common blood cancer. Despite extensive research, disease heterogeneity is poorly characterized, hampering efforts for early diagnosis and improved treatments. Here, we apply single cell RNA sequencing to study the heterogeneity of 40 individuals along the multiple myeloma progression spectrum, including 11 healthy controls, demonstrating high interindividual variability that can be explained by expression of known multiple myeloma drivers and additional putative factors. We identify extensive subclonal structures for 10 of 29 individuals with multiple myeloma. In asymptomatic individuals with early disease and in those with minimal residual disease post-treatment, we detect rare tumor plasma cells with molecular characteristics similar to those of active myeloma, with possible implications for personalized therapies. Single cell analysis of rare circulating tumor cells allows for accurate liquid biopsy and detection of malignant plasma cells, which reflect bone marrow disease. Our work establishes single cell RNA sequencing for dissecting blood malignancies and devising detailed molecular characterization of tumor cells in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.",1

Here, we have generated high-content single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of human blood and bone marrow that quantitatively link the expression of up to 197 surface markers to cellular identities and biological processes across all main hematopoietic cell types in healthy aging and leukemia. These reference maps enable the automatic design of cost-effective high-throughput cytometry schemes that outperform state-of-the-art approaches, accurately reflect complex topologies of cellular systems and permit the purification of precisely defined cell states.

1037,"During postnatal life, thymopoiesis depends on the continuous colonization of the thymus by bone-marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors that migrate through the bloodstream. The current understanding of the nature of thymic immigrants is largely based on data from pre-clinical models. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to examine the immature postnatal thymocyte population in humans. Integration of bone marrow and peripheral blood precursor datasets identified two putative thymus seeding progenitors that varied in expression of CD7; CD10; and the homing receptors CCR7, CCR9, and ITGB7. Whereas both precursors supported T cell development, only one contributed to intrathymic dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, predominantly of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Trajectory inference delineated the transcriptional dynamics underlying early human T lineage development, enabling prediction of transcription factor (TF) modules that drive stage-specific steps of human T cell development. This comprehensive dataset defines the expression signature of immature human thymocytes and provides a resource for the further study of human thymopoiesis.",1

Transcriptomics-derived keratinocyte subpopulations reflect classic epidermal strata but also sharply compartmentalize epithelial functions such as cell-cell communication, inflammation, and WNT pathway modulation. In keratinocytes, ∼12% of assessed transcript expression varies in coordinate patterns, revealing undescribed gene expression programs governing epidermal homeostasis. We also identify molecular fingerprints of inflammatory skin states, including S100 activation in the interfollicular epidermis of normal scalp, enrichment of a CD1C+CD301A+ myeloid dendritic cell population in psoriatic epidermis, and IL1βhiCCL3hiCD14+ monocyte-derived macrophages enriched in foreskin.

1102,"As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic errors that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic transformation such as cancer. Because aging reflects a stochastic process of increas ing disorder, cells in an organ will be individually affected in different ways, thus rendering bulk analyses of postmitotic adult cells difficult to interpret. Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life. We find that islet endocrine cells from older donors display increased levels of transcriptional noise and potential fate drift. By determining the mutational history of individual cells, we uncover a novel mutational signature in healthy aging endocrine cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from primary cells to derive insights into genetic and transcriptional processes that operate on aging human tissue.",1

1141,"It is not fully understood why COVID-19 is typically milder in children. Here, to examine the differences between children and adults in their response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analysed paediatric and adult patients with COVID-19 as well as healthy control individuals (total n = 93) using single-cell multi-omic profiling of matched nasal, tracheal, bronchial and blood samples. In the airways of healthy paediatric individuals, we observed cells that were already in an interferon-activated state, which after SARS-CoV-2 infection was further induced especially in airway immune cells. We postulate that higher paediatric innate interferon responses restrict viral replication and disease progression. The systemic response in children was characterized by increases in naive lymphocytes and a depletion of natural killer cells, whereas, in adults, cytotoxic T cells and interferon-stimulated subpopulations were significantly increased. We provide evidence that dendritic cells initiate interferon signalling in early infection, and identify epithelial cell states associated with COVID-19 and age. Our matching nasal and blood data show a strong interferon response in the airways with the induction of systemic interferon-stimulated populations, which were substantially reduced in paediatric patients. Together, we provide several mechanisms that explain the milder clinical syndrome observed in children.",1

1152,"Individuals of Asian ancestry constitute 60% of the global population, but have been underrepresented in genomics studies. Given the pervasive influence of dimensions of human diversity such as age, ancestry, and sex on biomedically relevant phenotypes, the construction of healthy, reference atlases for disease comparisons requires equitable and diverse representation from all population groups. In the first phase of the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas, we profiled 1,058,909 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 503 healthy donors spanning five Asian ancestries across Japan, Singapore, and South Korea alongside common controls via 5’-single-cell RNA sequencing. We elucidated cell type proportion and cell state enrichment signatures and differences across ancestries, ages, and sexes, including interactions between these demographics that influenced single cell phenotypes. We performed single-cell pseudobulk expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses for 19 immune cell subtypes, identifying more than 11,000 genes associated with such eQTLs, and thereafter integratively analysed these data with datasets from genome-wide association studies to prioritise causal genes and loci and implicated cell subtypes. Our resource is the first healthy reference atlas to include multiple Asian population groups and more broadly to examine the influence of ancestry on variation in single cell phenotypes, with the potential to facilitate precision medicine efforts in Asia.",1

We hypothesize that BE-IM and GIM follow parallel developmental trajectories in response to differing inflammatory insults. Here, we construct a single-cell RNA-seq atlas, supported by protein expression studies, of the entire gastrointestinal tract spanning physiologically normal and pathological states including: gastric metaplasia in the esophagus (E-GM), BE-IM, atrophic gastritis and GIM. We demonstrate that BE-IM and GIM share molecular features, and individual cells simultaneously possess transcriptional properties of gastric and intestinal epithelia, suggesting phenotypic mosaicism. Transcriptionally E-GM resembles atrophic gastritis; genetically, it is clonal and has a lower mutational burden than BE-IM. Finally, we show that GIM and BE-IM acquire a pro-tumorigenic, activated fibroblast microenvironment. These findings suggest that BE-IM and GIM can be considered molecularly similar entities in adjacent organs opening the path for shared detection and treatment strategies.",1

1183,"Cancer tumors are composed by a wide variety of cells with genetic and transcriptional alterations accumulated throughout tumor progression. This intra-tumoral heterogeneity provides adaptability of the tumor. Cell niches enriched with transcriptional signatures for cell renewal, adaptation and resistance to DNA damage induced by radiation (radiotherapy resistance) have been identified within some cancer tumors. Therefore, it seems that intra-tumoral heterogeneity imposes deep challenges to current therapeutic treatments. 
Tumors of the central nervous system are the most common solid tumors during childhood and are in the top-two causes of cancer-related death in children worldwide. Gliomas arise from glial precursor cells that are present in the brain and spinal cord and astrocytoma is the most commonly diagnosed type of glioma in children. Despite similar origin, astrocytomas behave differently depending on their location. Pilocytic astrocytoma that arise in cerebellum are more resilient and display a higher relapse degree after removal compared to those ones that arise in cerebrum. We will compare the transcritome of single nuclei from pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma from cerebellum in two time points (i.e., newly diagnosed vs relapse) plus healthy tissues. We predict that cells that produce tumor relapse will be present in both time points. Therefore, based on their transcriptional profiles, we will be able to identify them. This information will provide a deep knowledge about tumor relapse that can be extrapolated to other tumors and will offer RNA biomarkers for therapeutic purposes.",1

1193,"Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, patients with and survivors of COVID-19 can suffer neurological symptoms1,2,3. However, an unbiased understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that are affected in the brains of patients with COVID-19 is missing. Here we profile 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 30 frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples across 14 control individuals (including 1 patient with terminal influenza) and 8 patients with COVID-19. Although our systematic analysis yields no molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, we observe broad cellular perturbations indicating that barrier cells of the choroid plexus sense and relay peripheral inflammation into the brain and show that peripheral T cells infiltrate the parenchyma. We discover microglia and astrocyte subpopulations associated with COVID-19 that share features with pathological cell states that have previously been reported in human neurodegenerative disease4,5,6. Synaptic signalling of upper-layer excitatory neurons—which are evolutionarily expanded in humans7 and linked to cognitive function8—is preferentially affected in COVID-19. Across cell types, perturbations associated with COVID-19 overlap with those found in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognition, schizophrenia and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework to understand current observations of COVID-19-related neurological disease, and any such disease that may emerge at a later date.",1

We have validated some of these insights by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence, and functional analyses. Furthermore, we show both common and differential features of the cellular landscapes between the human and mouse ilea.

These major cell classes can be further classified into hundreds of distinct cell subtypes. The development of the retina is under tight temporal control where multipotent progenitor cells differentiate into specific mature cell types in a sequential, but overlapping, order. Additionally, the developmental process is under tight spatial control, with cells at the central retina developing earlier than cells at the periphery. To provide a comprehensive view of the human fetal retina at the molecular level and investigate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling the differentiation process, we profiled more than 300,000 single nuclei of the human fetal retina from 12 donors spanning post conception week 10 and 23 with Multiome RNA-seq and ATAC-seq.",1

1242,"The retina is the innermost tissue of the eyes of human and most other vertebrates. It receives the information of the visual images like the film of a camera and then translates the images into neural signals. As the neural signals get transduced to and processed by the brain, the visual perception is created. Different cell types in the retina functions in various ways to accomplish the whole procedure.

In the human retina, the major cell types could be further classified into subtypes based on their morphology, physiology features or functions, and molecular markers. To date, it is estimated that there are over 70 cell types in the human retina according to a previous primate study. Reliable classification of those neurons is required to manage the complexity of such level. Single-nuclei RNA-seq were carried out to profile well-characterized healthy human retina from six individual donors using the 10x Genomics technologies. Each donor retina was dissected into three geographic regions: the fovea, macula, and peripheral retina and flash frozen afterwards. A fractionation protocol was developed to enrich nuclei from rare neuron cell types, including bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells. In total, over 60 cell types are identified in our dataset, making the currently most comprehensive single-cell profiling of adult human retina.",1

1264,"Chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) has been proposed as a type of epigenomic modifier. Here, we test whether environmental stress can induce cellular dysfunction through modulating RNA-chromatin interactions. We induce endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction with high glucose and TNFα (H + T), that mimic the common stress in diabetes mellitus. We characterize the H + T-induced changes in gene expression by single cell (sc)RNA-seq, DNA interactions by Hi-C, and RNA-chromatin interactions by iMARGI. H + T induce inter-chromosomal RNA-chromatin interactions, particularly among the super enhancers. To test the causal relationship between H + T-induced RNA-chromatin interactions and the expression of EC dysfunction-related genes, we suppress the LINC00607 RNA. This suppression attenuates the expression of SERPINE1, a critical pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene. Furthermore, the changes of the co-expression gene network between diabetic and healthy donor-derived ECs corroborate the H + T-induced RNA-chromatin interactions. Taken together, caRNA-mediated dysregulation of gene expression modulates EC dysfunction, a crucial mechanism underlying numerous diseases.",1

1275,"We generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of the developing mouse lung that included epithelial, endothelial, and mesenchymal compartments from time points that span embryonic and postnatal stages. We then analyzed ligand and receptor interactions and identified the alveolar type 1 (AT1) epithelial cell as a hub of ligand expression. The cognate receptors for these ligands were restricted to subsets of developing mesenchymal cells. Mesenchymal progenitors are spatially and transcriptionally segregated into Acta2-, Pdgfrb-, or Wnt2-expressing subsets and are committed to generating distinct fibroblasts in the postnatal lung by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5). We show with scRNA-seq and lineage tracing that the progenitors for the transient secondary crest myofibroblast (SCMF), which exists only during the early postnatal alveolarization period of lung development, are spatially and transcriptionally aligned with AT1 cell progenitors. In comparison with other alveolar fibroblasts, SCMFs exert significantly more traction force ex vivo, indicating that they are a functionally specialized lineage that can remodel the alveolus. To identify intercellular signaling pathways that regulate cell lineage identity, we examined the single-cell chromatin accessibility and pathway expression (SCAPE) of AT1s and SCMFs. We identified Foxa and Tead transcription factors as upstream regulators of several AT1-derived ligands, including Shh and Wnt ligands. Conversely, SCMFs exhibit open chromatin with predicted Gli1 and Tcf target genes, implicating Shh and Wnt pathways in their development and function. To test these pathways, we generated AT1 cell–specific conditional deletions for Wnt-ligand secretion (Wls) and Shh. Conditional ablation of Shh from AT1 cells results in a loss of SCMF cells and subsequent alveolar simplification in the postnatal lung.",1

1286,"The human neonatal cerebellum is one-fourth of its adult size yet contains the blueprint required to integrate environmental cues with developing motor, cognitive and emotional skills into adulthood. Although mature cerebellar neuroanatomy is well studied, understanding of its developmental origins is limited. In this study, we systematically mapped the molecular, cellular and spatial composition of human fetal cerebellum by combining laser capture microscopy and SPLiT-seq single-nucleus transcriptomics. We profiled functionally distinct regions and gene expression dynamics within cell types and across development. The resulting cell atlas demonstrates that the molecular organization of the cerebellar anlage recapitulates cytoarchitecturally distinct regions and developmentally transient cell types that are distinct from the mouse cerebellum. By mapping genes dominant for pediatric and adult neurological disorders onto our dataset, we identify relevant cell types underlying disease mechanisms. These data provide a resource for probing the cellular basis of human cerebellar development and disease.",1

1297,"Variation in cortical cytoarchitecture is the basis for histology-based definition of cortical areas, such as Brodmann areas. Single cell transcriptomics enables higher-resolution characterization of cell types in human cortex, which we used to revisit the idea of the canonical cortical microcircuit and to understand functional areal specialization. Deeply sampled single nucleus RNA-sequencing of eight cortical areas spanning cortical structural variation showed highly consistent cellular makeup for 24 coarse cell subclasses. However, proportions of excitatory neuron subclasses varied strikingly, reflecting differences in intra- and extracortical connectivity across primary sensorimotor and association cortices. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also showed differences in laminar organization across areas. Primary visual cortex showed dramatically different organization, including major differences in the ratios of excitatory to inhibitory neurons, expansion of layer 4 excitatory neuron types and specialized inhibitory neurons. Finally, gene expression variation in conserved neuron subclasses predicts differences in synaptic function across areas. Together these results provide a refined cellular and molecular characterization of human cortical cytoarchitecture that reflects functional connectivity and predicts areal specialization.",1

1317,"Gonadal development is a complex process that involves sex determination followed by divergent maturation into either testes or ovaries1. Historically, limited tissue accessibility, a lack of reliable in vitro models and critical differences between humans and mice have hampered our knowledge of human gonadogenesis, despite its importance in gonadal conditions and infertility. Here, we generated a comprehensive map of first- and second-trimester human gonads using a combination of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility assays and fluorescent microscopy. We extracted human-specific regulatory programmes that control the development of germline and somatic cell lineages by profiling equivalent developmental stages in mice. In both species, we define the somatic cell states present at the time of sex specification, including the bipotent early supporting population that, in males, upregulates the testis-determining factor SRY and sPAX8s, a gonadal lineage located at the gonadal–mesonephric interface. In females, we resolve the cellular and molecular events that give rise to the first and second waves of granulosa cells that compartmentalize the developing ovary to modulate germ cell differentiation. In males, we identify human SIGLEC15+ and TREM2+ fetal testicular macrophages, which signal to somatic cells outside and inside the developing testis cords, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of human and mouse gonadal differentiation, which can guide in vitro gonadogenesis.",1

1336,"Castration-insensitive epithelial progenitors capable of regenerating the prostate have been proposed to be concentrated in the proximal region based on facultative assays. Functional characterization of prostate epithelial populations isolated with individual cell surface markers has failed to provide a consensus on the anatomical and transcriptional identity of proximal prostate progenitors. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to obtain a complete transcriptomic profile of all epithelial cells in the mouse prostate and urethra to objectively identify cellular subtypes. Pan-transcriptomic comparison to human prostate cell types identified a mouse equivalent of human urethral luminal cells, which highly expressed putative prostate progenitor markers. Validation of the urethral luminal cell cluster was performed using immunostaining and flow cytometry. Our data reveal that previously identified facultative progenitors marked by Trop2, Sca-1, KRT4, and PSCA are actually luminal epithelial cells of the urethra that extend into the proximal region of the prostate, and are resistant to castration-induced androgen deprivation. Mouse urethral luminal cells were identified to be the equivalent of previously identified human club and hillock cells that similarly extend into proximal prostate ducts. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has long been considered an ""embryonic reawakening,"" but the cellular origin of the hyperplastic growth concentrated in the periurethral region is unclear. We demonstrate an increase in urethral luminal cells within glandular nodules from BPH patients. Urethral luminal cells are further increased in patients treated with a 5-α reductase inhibitor. Our data demonstrate that cells of the proximal prostate that express putative progenitor markers, and are enriched by castration in the proximal prostate, are urethral luminal cells and that these cells may play an important role in the etiology of human BPH.",1

While fibroblast heterogeneity is well established, this phenomenon has not been analyzed systematically yet. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptomes of more than 5,000 fibroblasts from a sun-protected area in healthy human donors. Our results define four main subpopulations that can be spatially localized and show differential secretory, mesenchymal and pro-inflammatory functional annotations. Importantly, we found that this fibroblast ‘priming’ becomes reduced with age. We also show that aging causes a substantial reduction in the predicted interactions between dermal fibroblasts and other skin cells, including undifferentiated keratinocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction. Our work thus provides evidence for a functional specialization of human dermal fibroblasts and identifies the partial loss of cellular identity as an important age-related change in the human dermis. These findings have important implications for understanding human skin aging and its associated phenotypes.",1

1357,"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has advanced the assessment of cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell resolution by identifying transcriptional similarities and differences. While several sets of mouse retinal scRNA-seq data have been published, each dataset either has a relatively small number of cells or is limited to a subset of cell types, making each dataset incomplete and suboptimal for the vision community to use. To establish a unified and comprehensive reference for the mouse retina, we first generated the most comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 190,000 single cells from the C57BL/6J mouse retina. This dataset was generated through the targeted enrichment of rare population cells via the application of CD73- and CD90.1+ antibody treatments. By integrating this new dataset with public datasets, we conducted an integrated analysis to construct the Mouse Retina Cell Atlas (MRCA) for wild-type mice, which encompasses over 323,000 single cells. The MRCA characterizes 11 major classes and 137 cell types. It captured consensus cell type characterization from public datasets and identified additional new cell types, such as new cell types for two retinal ganglion cell types, 16_ooDS_DV and 18_Novel. Cross-comparison with functional annotation enabled the novel naming of RGC types. To facilitate the public use of the MRCA, we have deposited it on CELLxGENE, UCSC Cell Browser, and Single Cell Portal for visualization and gene expression exploration. The comprehensive MRCA serves as an easy-to-use, one-stop data resource for the mouse retina communities.",1

To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex. We define 133 transcriptomic cell types by deep, single-cell RNA sequencing. Nearly all types of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing and retrograde labelling, we match transcriptomic types of glutamatergic neurons to their long-range projection specificity.

We used comparative single nucleus transcriptomics in adult humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, and common marmosets from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) to understand human-specific features of cellular and molecular organization. Human, chimpanzee, and gorilla MTG showed highly similar cell type composition and laminar organization, and a large shift in proportions of deep layer intratelencephalic-projecting neurons compared to macaque and marmoset. Species differences in gene expression generally mirrored evolutionary distance and were seen in all cell types, although chimpanzees were more similar to gorillas than humans, consistent with faster divergence along the human lineage. Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes showed accelerated gene expression changes compared to neurons or oligodendrocyte precursor cells, indicating either relaxed evolutionary constraints or positive selection in these cell types. Only a few hundred genes showed human-specific patterning in all or specific cell types, and were significantly enriched near human accelerated regions (HARs) and conserved deletions (hCONDELS) and in cell adhesion and intercellular signaling pathways. These results suggest that relatively few cellular and molecular changes uniquely define adult human cortical structure, particularly by affecting circuit connectivity and glial cell function.",1

1431,"The human brain's temporal lobe contains the entorhinal cortex (EC), a highly interconnected integrative hub for sensory and spatial information; key for episodic memory formation and the primary source of cortical hippocampal inputs.  The human EC continues to develop during childhood, yet neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered complete by birth.  Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions; with a large tangential stream persisting ~1 year and radial dispersal until ~2-3 years.  In contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).  Immunostaining and single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of ganglionic eminence (GE) germinal zones, EC stream, and postnatal EC reveals that most EC stream migrating cells are derived from the caudal GE and become LAMP5+RELN+ inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first brain regions affected in Alzheimer’s disease and recent work links the decline in cognitive function to the loss of LAMP5+RELN+ cells. Our investigation reveals that many of these cells arrive in the EC through a major postnatal migratory stream in early childhood.",1

1461,"The cellular diversity and complexity of the kidney are on par with its physiological intricacy. Although our anatomical understanding of the different segments and their functions is supported by a plethora of research, the identification of distinct and rare cell populations and their markers remains elusive. Here, we leverage the large number of cells and nuclei profiles using single-cell (scRNA-seq) and single-nuclei (snRNA-seq) RNA-sequencing to build a comprehensive atlas of the adult mouse kidney. We created MKA (Mouse Kidney Atlas) by integrating 59 publicly available single-cell and single-nuclei transcriptomic datasets from eight independent studies. The atlas contains more than 140.000 cells and nuclei covering different single-cell technologies, age, and tissue sections. To harmonize annotations across datasets, we constructed a hierarchical model of the cell populations present in our atlas. Using this hierarchy, we trained a model to automatically identify cells in unannotated datasets and evaluated its performance against well-established methods and annotation references. Our learnt model is dynamic, allowing the incorporation of novel cell populations and refinement of known profiles as more datasets become available. Using MKA and the learned model of cellular hierarchies, we predicted previously missing cell annotations from several studies and characterized well-studied and rare cell populations. This allowed us to identify reproducible markers across studies for poorly understood cell types and transitional states.",1

1470,"The anterior segment of the eye consists of the cornea, iris, ciliary body, crystalline lens, and aqueous humor outflow pathways. Together, these tissues are essential for the proper functioning of the eye. Disorders of vision have been ascribed to defects in all of them; some disorders, including glaucoma and cataract, are among the most prevalent causes of blindness in the world. To characterize the cell types that compose these tissues, we generated an anterior segment cell atlas of the human eye using high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq). We profiled 195,248 nuclei from nondiseased anterior segment tissues of six human donors, identifying >60 cell types. Many of these cell types were discrete, whereas others, especially in the lens and cornea, formed continua corresponding to known developmental transitions that persist in adulthood. Having profiled each tissue separately, we performed an integrated analysis of the entire anterior segment, revealing that some cell types are unique to a single structure, whereas others are shared across tissues. The integrated cell atlas was then used to investigate cell type–specific expression patterns of more than 900 human ocular disease genes identified through either Mendelian inheritance patterns or genome-wide association studies.",1

Here, we use bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of human palm, sole, and hip skin to describe the distinguishing characteristics of palmoplantar and non-palmoplantar skin while also uncovering differences between palmar and plantar sites. Our approach reveals an altered immune environment in palmoplantar skin, with downregulation of diverse immunological processes and decreased immune cell populations. Further, we identify specific fibroblast populations that appear to orchestrate key differences in cell-cell communication in palm, sole, and hip. Dedicated keratinocyte analysis highlights major differences in basal cell fraction among the three sites and demonstrates the existence of two spinous keratinocyte populations constituting parallel, site-selective epidermal differentiation trajectories. In summary, this deep characterization of highly adapted palmoplantar skin contributes key insights into the fundamental biology of human skin and provides a valuable data resource for further investigation.",1

Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design.

This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from ≥ 5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types.

We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific.

In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing.",1

1513,"The expansion of the neocortex, a hallmark of mammalian evolution, was accompanied by an increase in cerebellar neuron numbers. However, little is known about the evolution of the cellular programs underlying cerebellum development in mammals. In this study, we generated single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data for ~400,000 cells to trace cerebellum development from early neurogenesis to adulthood in human, mouse, and the marsupial opossum. We established a consensus classification of the cellular diversity in the developing mammalian cerebellum and validated it by spatial mapping in the fetal human cerebellum. Our cross-species analyses revealed largely conserved developmental dynamics of cell type generation, except for Purkinje cells, where we observed an expansion of early-born subtypes in the human lineage. Global transcriptome profiles, conserved cell state markers, and gene expression trajectories across neuronal differentiation show that cerebellar cell type-defining programs have been preserved for at least 160 million years. However, we also identified many orthologous genes that gained or lost expression in cerebellar neural cell types in one of the species, or evolved new expression trajectories during neuronal differentiation, indicating widespread gene repurposing at the cell type level. Altogether, our study unveils shared and lineage-specific programs governing the development of cerebellar cells, and expands our understanding of mammalian brain evolution.",1

1535,"The cerebellum is a well-studied brain structure with diverse roles in motor learning, coordination, cognition, and autonomic regulation. Nonetheless, a complete inventory of cerebellar cell types is presently lacking. We used high-throughput transcriptional profiling to molecularly define cell types across individual lobules of the adult mouse cerebellum. Purkinje and granule neurons showed considerable regional specialization, with the greatest diversity occurring in the posterior lobules. For multiple types of cerebellar interneurons, the molecular variation within each type was more continuous, rather than discrete. For the unipolar brush cells (UBCs)—an interneuron population previously subdivided into two discrete populations—the continuous variation in gene expression was associated with a graded continuum of electrophysiological properties. Most surprisingly, we found that molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) were composed of two molecularly and functionally distinct types. Both show a continuum of morphological variation through the thickness of the molecular layer, but electrophysiological recordings revealed marked differences between the two types in spontaneous firing, excitability, and electrical coupling. Together, these findings provide the first comprehensive cellular atlas of the cerebellar cortex, and outline a methodological and conceptual framework for the integration of molecular, morphological, and physiological ontologies for defining brain cell types.",1

Haematopoiesis first emerges in human BM at 11–12 weeks after conception, yet almost nothing is known about how fetal BM (FBM) evolves to meet the highly specialized needs of the fetus and newborn. Here we detail the development of FBM, including stroma, using multi-omic assessment of mRNA and multiplexed protein epitope expression. We find that the full blood and immune cell repertoire is established in FBM in a short time window of 6–7 weeks early in the second trimester. FBM promotes rapid and extensive diversification of myeloid cells, with granulocytes, eosinophils and dendritic cell subsets emerging for the first time. The substantial expansion of B lymphocytes in FBM contrasts with fetal liver at the same gestational age. Haematopoietic progenitors from fetal liver, FBM and cord blood exhibit transcriptional and functional differences that contribute to tissue-specific identity and cellular diversification. Endothelial cell types form distinct vascular structures that we show are regionally compartmentalized within FBM. Finally, we reveal selective disruption of B lymphocyte, erythroid and myeloid development owing to a cell-intrinsic differentiation bias as well as extrinsic regulation through an altered microenvironment in Down syndrome (trisomy 21).",1

1587,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an evolving technology used to elucidate the cellular architecture of adult organs. Previous scRNA-seq on breast tissue utilized reduction mammoplasty samples, which are often histologically abnormal. We report a rapid tissue collection/processing protocol to perform scRNA-seq of breast biopsies of healthy women and identify 23 breast epithelial cell clusters. Putative cell-of-origin signatures derived from these clusters are applied to analyze transcriptomes of ~3,000 breast cancers. Gene signatures derived from mature luminal cell clusters are enriched in ~68% of breast cancers, whereas a signature from a luminal progenitor cluster is enriched in ~20% of breast cancers. Overexpression of luminal progenitor cluster-derived signatures in HER2+, but not in other subtypes, is associated with unfavorable outcome. We identify TBX3 and PDK4 as genes co-expressed with estrogen receptor (ER) in the normal breasts, and their expression analyses in >550 breast cancers enable prognostically relevant subclassification of ER+ breast cancers.",1

1609,"Understanding the function of genes and their regulation in tissue homeostasis and disease requires knowing the cellular context in which genes are expressed in tissues across the body. Single cell genomics allows the generation of detailed cellular atlases in human tissues, but most efforts are focused on single tissue types. Here, we establish a framework for profiling multiple tissues across the human body at single-cell resolution using single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-seq), and apply it to 8 diverse, archived, frozen tissue types (three donors per tissue). We apply four snRNA-seq methods to each of 25 samples from 16 donors, generating a cross-tissue atlas of 209,126 nuclei profiles, and benchmark them vs. scRNA-seq of comparable fresh tissues. We use a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) to integrate an atlas across tissues, donors, and laboratory methods. We highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident immune cells, identifying tissue-restricted and non-restricted resident myeloid populations. These include a cross-tissue conserved dichotomy between LYVE1- and HLA class II-expressing macrophages, and the broad presence of LAM-like macrophages across healthy tissues that is also observed in disease. For rare, monogenic muscle diseases, we identify cell types that likely underlie the neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of these diseases, and biological processes involved in their pathology. For common complex diseases and traits analyzed by GWAS, we identify the cell types and gene modules that potentially underlie disease mechanisms. The experimental and analytical frameworks we describe will enable the generation of large-scale studies of how cellular and molecular processes vary across individuals and populations.",1

1629,"Adipogenesis is key to maintaining organism-wide energy balance and healthy metabolic phenotype, making it critical to thoroughly comprehend its molecular regulation in humans. By single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of over 20,000 differentiating white and brown preadipocytes, we constructed a high-resolution temporal transcriptional landscape of human white and brown adipogenesis. White and brown preadipocytes were isolated from a single individual's neck region, thereby eliminating inter-subject variability across two distinct lineages. These preadipocytes were also immortalized to allow for controlled, in vitro differentiation, allowing sampling of distinct cellular states across the spectrum of adipogenic progression. Pseudotemporal cellular ordering revealed the dynamics of ECM remodeling during early adipogenesis, and lipogenic/thermogenic response during late white/brown adipogenesis. Comparison with adipogenic regulation in murine models Identified several novel transcription factors as potential targets for adipogenic/thermogenic drivers in humans. Among these novel candidates, we explored the role of TRPS1 in adipocyte differentiation and showed that its knockdown impairs white adipogenesis in vitro. Key adipogenic and lipogenic markers revealed in our analysis were applied to analyze publicly available scRNA-seq datasets; these confirmed unique cell maturation features in recently discovered murine preadipocytes, and revealed inhibition of adipogenic expansion in humans with obesity. Overall, our study presents a comprehensive molecular description of both white and brown adipogenesis in humans and provides an important resource for future studies of adipose tissue development and function in both health and metabolic disease state.",1

Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require deeper understanding of the healthy heart’s molecular processes. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavor.

Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, revealing distinct atrial and ventricular subsets with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment we identify cardiac resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Further, inference of cell-cell interactions highlight different macrophage-fibroblast-cardiomyocyte networks between atria and ventricles that are distinct from skeletal muscle.

To interrogate this diversity during human development, we generate a single-cell transcriptome atlas from multiple developing endodermal organs of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. We illuminate cell states, transcription factors, and organ-specific epithelial stem cell and mesenchyme interactions across lineages. We implement the atlas as a high-dimensional search space to benchmark human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) under multiple culture conditions. We show that HIOs recapitulate reference cell states and use HIOs to reconstruct the molecular dynamics of intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme emergence. We show that the mesenchyme-derived niche cue NRG1 enhances intestinal stem cell maturation in vitro and that the homeobox transcription factor CDX2 is required for regionalization of intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme in humans.

Here, we study the differentiation state and cellular origin of 1300 childhood and adult kidney tumors. Using single cell mRNA reference maps of normal tissues, we quantify reference “cellular signals” in each tumor. Quantifying global differentiation, we find that childhood tumors exhibit fetal cellular signals, replacing the presumption of “fetalness” with a quantitative measure of immaturity. By contrast, in adult cancers our assessment refutes the suggestion of dedifferentiation towards a fetal state in most cases. We find an intimate connection between developmental mesenchymal populations and childhood renal tumors.

It consists of over 2 million cells  from the respiratory tract of 486 individuals, and includes 49 different datasets. It is split into the HLCA core, and the extended or full HLCA.
The HLCA core includes data of healthy lung tissue from 107 individuals, and includes manual cell type annotations based on consensus across 6 independent experts, as well as demographic, biological and technical metadata. The datasets in the HLCA core were integrated using scANVI. The HLCA core can be used as a reference to map new datasets onto using scArches.
The full HLCA includes 35 further  datasets that include donors with various lung diseases. These datasets were mapped onto the core with scArches, and include disease annotations as well as cell type annotations transferred from the HLCA core onto the mapped datasets.
Note that while the the HLCA includes an integrated, batch-correctd low-dimensional embedding, the gene counts themselves were not batch-corrected.

1698,"The neocortex is disproportionately expanded in human compared to mouse, both in its total volume relative to subcortical structures and in the proportion occupied by supragranular layers that selectively make connections within the cortex and other telencephalic structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human and mouse cortex show an increased diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in supragranular cortex in human and pronounced gradients as a function of cortical depth. To probe the functional and anatomical correlates of this transcriptomic diversity, we describe a robust Patch-seq platform using neurosurgically-resected human tissues. We characterize the morphological and physiological properties of five transcriptomically defined human glutamatergic supragranular neuron types. Three of these types have properties that are specialized compared to the more homogeneous properties of transcriptomically defined homologous mouse neuron types. The two remaining supragranular neuron types, located exclusively in deep layer 3, do not have clear mouse homologues in supragranular cortex but are transcriptionally most similar to deep layer mouse intratelencephalic-projecting neuron types. Furthermore, we reveal the transcriptomic types in deep layer 3 that express high levels of non-phosphorylated heavy chain neurofilament protein that label long-range neurons known to be selectively depleted in Alzheimer’s disease. Together, these results demonstrate the power of transcriptomic cell type classification, provide a mechanistic underpinning for increased complexity of cortical function in human cortical evolution, and implicate discrete transcriptomic cell types as selectively vulnerable in disease.",1

1709,"The myelinated white matter tracts of the central nervous system (CNS) are essential for fast transmission of electrical impulses and are often differentially affected in human neurodegenerative diseases across CNS region, age and sex. We hypothesize that this selective vulnerability is underpinned by physiological variation in white matter glia. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing of human post-mortem white matter samples from the brain, cerebellum and spinal cord and subsequent tissue-based validation we found substantial glial heterogeneity with tissue region: we identified region-specific oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that retain developmental origin markers into adulthood, distinguishing them from mouse OPCs. Region-specific OPCs give rise to similar oligodendrocyte populations, however spinal cord oligodendrocytes exhibit markers such as SKAP2 which are associated with increased myelin production and we found a spinal cord selective population particularly equipped for producing long and thick myelin sheaths based on the expression of genes/proteins such as HCN2. Spinal cord microglia exhibit a more activated phenotype compared to brain microglia, suggesting that the spinal cord is a more pro-inflammatory environment, a difference that intensifies with age. Astrocyte gene expression correlates strongly with CNS region, however, astrocytes do not show a more activated state with region or age. Across all glia, sex differences are subtle but the consistent increased expression of protein-folding genes in male donors hints at pathways that may contribute to sex differences in disease susceptibility. These findings are essential to consider for understanding selective CNS pathologies and developing tailored therapeutic strategies.",1

1718,"The isocortex and hippocampal formation (HPF) in the mammalian brain play critical roles in perception, cognition, emotion, and learning. We profiled ∼1.3 million cells covering the entire adult mouse isocortex and HPF and derived a transcriptomic cell-type taxonomy revealing a comprehensive repertoire of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron types. Contrary to the traditional view of HPF as having a simpler cellular organization, we discover a complete set of glutamatergic types in HPF homologous to all major subclasses found in the six-layered isocortex, suggesting that HPF and the isocortex share a common circuit organization. We also identify large-scale continuous and graded variations of cell types along isocortical depth, across the isocortical sheet, and in multiple dimensions in hippocampus and subiculum. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex and hippocampal formation and begins to shed light on its underlying relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity, and function of these two brain structures.",1

1729,"FGID samples from the paper ""Concerted changes in the pediatric single-cell intestinal ecosystem before and after anti-TNF blockade"". Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which most often presents with patchy lesions in the terminal ileum and colon and requires complex clinical care. Recent advances in the targeting of cytokines and leukocyte migration have greatly advanced treatment options, but most patients still relapse and inevitably progress. Although single-cell approaches are transforming our ability to understand the barrier tissue biology of inflammatory disease, comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases of IBD to date have largely sampled pre-treated patients with established disease. This has limited our understanding of which cell types, subsets, and states at diagnosis are predictive of disease severity and response to treatment. Here, through a combined clinical, flow cytometric, and scRNA-seq study, we profile diagnostic human biopsies from the terminal ileum of treatment-naive pediatric patients with Crohn's disease(pediCD; n=14) and from non-inflamed pediatric controls with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID;n=13). To fully resolve and annotate epithelial, stromal, and immune cell states among the our 201,883 single-cell transcriptomes, we develop and deploy a principled and unbiased tiered clustering approach, ARBOL, yielding 138 FGID and 305 pediCD end cell clusters. Notably, through both flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, we observe that at the level of broad cell types, treatment-naive pediCD is not readily distinguishable from FGID in cellular composition. However, by integrating high-resolution scRNA-seq analysis, we identify significant differences in cell states that arise during pediCD relative to FGID. Furthermore, by closely linking our scRNA-seq analysis with clinical meta-data, we resolve a vector of lymphoid, myeloid, and epithelial cell states in treatment-naive samples which can distinguish patients with less severe disease (those not on anti-TNF therapies (NOA)), from those with more severe disease at presentation who require anti-TNF therapies.Moreover, this vector was also able to distinguish those patients that achieve a full response (FR) to anti-TNF blockade from those more treatment-resistant patients who only achieve a partial response (PR). Our study jointly leverages a treatment-naive cohort, high-resolution principled scRNA-seq data analysis, and clinical outcomes to understand which baseline cell states may predict inflammatory disease trajectory.",1

Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, Müller glia, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1 expression with longer post-mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult Müller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal biology and disease.",1

We detect extensive heterogeneity within and between patients, with enrichment of CD8A+ tissue-resident T cells in a patient responsive to ICB and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in a resistant patient. A TCR trajectory framework suggests distinct T cell differentiation pathways between patients responding and resistant to ICB.

Delineating the cells of origin for different RCC subtypes will provide mechanistic insights into their diverse pathobiology. Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to develop benign and malignant renal cell atlases. Using a random forest model trained on this cell atlas, we predicted the putative cell of origin for more than 10 RCC subtypes. scRNA-seq also revealed several attributes of the tumor microenvironment in the most common subtype of kidney cancer, clear cell RCC (ccRCC). We elucidated an active role for tumor epithelia in promoting immune cell infiltration, potentially explaining why ccRCC responds to immune checkpoint inhibitors, despite having a low neoantigen burden. In addition, we characterized an association between high endothelial cell types and lack of response to immunotherapy in ccRCC. Taken together, these single-cell analyses of benign kidney and RCC provide insight into the putative cell of origin for RCC subtypes and highlight the important role of the tumor microenvironment in influencing ccRCC biology and response to therapy.",1

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify interferon-responsive oligodendrocytes, which localize in proximity of CD8+ T cells in the aging white matter. Absence of functional lymphocytes decreased oligodendrocyte reactivity and rescued oligodendrocyte loss, while T-cell checkpoint inhibition worsened the aging effect. In addition, we identified a subpopulation of immune cell-dependent interferon-responsive microglia in the aging white matter, and co-culture experiments revealed that interferon-γ activated microglia triggered oligodendrocytes cell death. In summary, we provide evidence that T cells induced interferon-responsive oligodendrocytes and microglia are important modifiers of white matter aging.",1

1856,"Tumor behavior is intricately dependent on the oncogenic properties of cancer cells and their multi-cellular interactions. To understand these dependencies within the wider microenvironment, we studied over 270,000 single-cell transcriptomes and 100 microdissected whole exomes from 12 patients with kidney tumors, prior to validation using spatial transcriptomics. Tissues were sampled from multiple regions of the tumor core, the tumor-normal interface, normal surrounding tissues, and peripheral blood. We find that the tissue-type location of CD8+ T cell clonotypes largely defines their exhaustion state with intra-tumoral spatial heterogeneity that is not well explained by somatic heterogeneity. De novo mutation calling from single-cell RNA-sequencing data allows us to broadly infer the clonality of stromal cells and lineage-trace myeloid cell development. We report six conserved meta-programs that distinguish tumor cell function, and find an epithelial-mesenchymal transition meta-program highly enriched at the tumor-normal interface that co-localizes with IL1B-expressing macrophages, offering a potential therapeutic target.",1

1867,"Precise spatiotemporal orchestration of gene expression is required for proper embryonic development. The application of high throughput single-cell technologies has provided comprehensive transcriptomic definitions of cell states within the embryo, but our knowledge of their spatial localization remains elusive. To explore early mouse organogenesis, we used Slide-seq to generate high-resolution maps of whole E8.5 and E9.5 mouse embryos. We developed sc3D, a tool for creating a three-dimensional (3D) 'digital embryo,' which allowed us to quantitatively decipher regionalized gene expression across multiple tissues. Our transcriptomic maps facilitated us to characterize gene expression patterns along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes, with a particular emphasis on neural tube development. We nominated and functionally characterized Prdm8, a histone methyltransferase, as a neural tube patterning gene. Furthermore, we were able to determine the transcriptional identity of ectopic neural tubes in a classical Tbx6 mutant, which provided us with additional insights into neural tube patterning. Taken together, we present a framework for a computational and experimental toolkit that enables systematic spatiotemporal dissection of complex embryonic structures via high-throughput profiling of phenotypes, thereby paving the way for the investigation of congenital and developmental abnormalities.",1

1876,"Excitatory and inhibitory neurons establish specialized identities early in life through cell type-specific patterns of epigenetic regulation and gene expression. Although cell types are largely stable throughout the lifespan, altered transcriptional and epigenetic regulation may contribute to cognitive changes with advanced age. Using single nucleus multiomic DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing (snmCT-seq) in frontal cortex samples from young adult and aged donors, we found widespread age- and sex-related variability in specific neuronal cell types. The proportion of GABAergic inhibitory cells, including SST and VIP expressing cells, was reduced in aged donors. Excitatory neurons had more profound age-related changes in their gene expression and DNA methylation compared with inhibitory cells. Hundreds of genes involved in synaptic activity were downregulated, while genes located in subtelomeric regions were upregulated with age. We further mapped sex differences in autosomal gene expression and escape from X-inactivation in specific neuron types. Multiomic single nucleus epigenomes and transcriptomes provide new insight into the effects of age and sex on human neurons.",1

To link immune response variation to disease severity and outcome over time, we longitudinally assessed circulating proteins as well as 188 surface protein markers, transcriptome, and T cell receptor sequence simultaneously in single peripheral immune cells from COVID-19 patients. Conditional-independence network analysis revealed primary correlates of disease severity, including gene expression signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated inflammation but increased fatty acid metabolism in CD56(dim)CD16(hi) NK cells linked positively to circulating interleukin (IL)-15. CD8+ T cell activation was apparent without signs of exhaustion. Although cellular inflammation was depressed in severe patients early after hospitalization, it became elevated by days 17–23 post symptom onset, suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, circulating protein trajectories at this time were divergent between and predictive of recovery versus fatal outcomes. Our findings stress the importance of timing in the analysis, clinical monitoring, and therapeutic intervention of COVID-19",1

T cells mediate antigen-specific immune responses to disease through the specificity and diversity of their T-cell receptors (TCRs). Determining the spatial distributions of T cell clonotypes in tissues is essential to understanding T cell maturation and behavior, but spatial sequencing methods remain unable to profile the TCR repertoire. Here, we develop Slide-TCR-seq, a 10-µm-resolution method to sequence whole transcriptomes and TCRs within intact tissues. We confirm the ability of Slide-TCR-seq to map the characteristic architecture of T cells and their receptors in mouse spleen. In human lymph nodes and tonsil, we identified spatially distinct TCR repertoires. Spatial profiling of T cell clonotypes and their infiltration in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma specimens identified inter- and intra-clonotype transcriptional heterogeneity. Our method facilitates the dissection of the immune microenvironment, yielding insights into the complex spatial relationships between T cell clonotypes, neighboring cell types, and gene expression that drive T cell responses across diseases.",1

1909,"Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. CD is multifactorial, involving the complex interplay of genetic, immune, and environmental factors, necessitating a system-level understanding of its etiology. To characterize cell-type-specific transcriptional heterogeneity in active CD, we profiled 720,633 cells from the terminal ileum and colon of 71 donors with varying inflammation status. Our integrated datasets revealed organ- and compartment-specific responses to acute and chronic inflammation; most immune changes were in cell composition, whereas transcriptional changes dominated among epithelial and stromal cells. These changes correlated with endoscopic inflammation, but small and large intestines exhibited distinct responses, which were particularly apparent when focusing on IBD risk genes. Finally, we mapped markers of disease-associated myofibroblast activation and identified CHMP1A, TBX3, and RNF168 as regulators of fibrotic complications. Altogether, our results provide a roadmap for understanding cell-type- and organ-specific differences in CD and potential directions for therapeutic development.",1

To advance this, we present a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas in patients with varying COVID-19 severity and compare with influenza, sepsis and healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity revealed cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks as potential therapeutic targets, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Tensor and matrix decomposition of the overall dataset revealed feature groupings linked with disease severity and specificity. Our systems-based integrative approach and blood atlas will inform future drug development, clinical trial design and personalised medicine approaches for COVID-19. The complete raw and processed CITE-seq datasets are available at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and Zenodo respectively. Here a more limited version of the gene expression data is presented for the purpose of online visualisation and exploration of the dataset.

1940,"Stromal-epithelial interactions are critical to the morphogenesis, differentiation, and homeostasis of the prostate, but the molecular identity and anatomy of discrete stromal cell types is poorly understood. Using single cell RNA-sequencing, we identified and validated the in situ localization of three smooth muscle subtypes (prostate smooth muscle, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle) and two novel fibroblast subtypes in human prostate. Peri-epithelial fibroblasts (APOD+) wrap around epithelial structures while interstitial fibroblasts (C7+) are interspersed in extracellular matrix. In contrast, the mouse displayed three fibroblast subtypes with distinct proximal-distal and lobe specific distribution patterns. Statistical analysis of mouse and human fibroblasts showed transcriptional correlation between mouse prostate (C3+) and urethral (Lgr5+) fibroblasts and the human interstitial fibroblast subtype. Both urethral fibroblasts (Lgr5+) and ductal fibroblasts (Wnt2+) in the mouse contribute to a proximal Wnt/Tgfb signaling niche that is absent in human prostate. Instead, human peri-epithelial fibroblasts express secreted WNT inhibitors SFRPs and DKK1, which could serve as a buffer against stromal WNT ligands by creating a localized signaling niche around individual prostate glands. We also identified proximal-distal fibroblast density differences in human prostate that could amplify stromal signaling around proximal prostate ducts. In human Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, fibroblast subtypes upregulate critical immunoregulatory pathways and show distinct distributions in stromal and glandular phenotypes. A detailed taxonomy of leukocytes in BPH reveals an influx of myeloid dendritic cells, T cells and B cells, resembling a mucosal inflammatory disorder. A receptor-ligand interaction analysis of all cell types revealed a central role for fibroblasts in growth factor, morphogen and chemokine signaling to endothelia, epithelia, and leukocytes.

1950,"Mammalian brain cells are remarkably diverse in gene expression, anatomy, and function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly understood. We carried out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to profile 110,294 nuclei from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum, and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements, and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types, and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, an artificial neural network model was constructed that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data allowed prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse brain.",1

However, many individuals present with isolated upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential to constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx. Which cells SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets and how infection influences the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. We performed scRNA-seq on nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 healthy and COVID-19 participants. During COVID-19, we observe expansion of secretory, loss of ciliated, and epithelial cell repopulation via deuterosomal cell expansion. In mild and moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells express anti-viral/interferon-responsive genes, while cells in severe COVID-19 have muted anti-viral responses despite equivalent viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host-target cells are highly heterogenous, including developing ciliated, interferon-responsive ciliated, AZGP1high goblet, and KRT13+ “hillock”-like cells, and we identify genes associated with susceptibility, resistance, or infection response.
